# driver-control

In this project I use OpenCV for recognize the driver.<br>
If driver is alreay be registered in the car, car can able to run, otherwise can't.<br>
After car run, driver's informations will show on the screen.<br>
While driving, if driver is anger or drivers risk ratio is more than the limit, car gives a caution.
